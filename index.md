### Abstract

Morality presents a complex challenge within society, encompassing a broad spectrum of ethical dilemmas and conflicting perspectives. This research focuses on three crucial aspects -- blame assignment, moral reasoning, and moral incidents -- to explore real-life morality through insights gained from moral scenarios unfolding within social media platforms. These scenarios involve interpersonal moral situations shared by authors and judgments provided by other users. By adopting Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, we consider psychological theories and social commonsense with linguistic characteristics of the descriptive moral situations to explore how individuals perceive and respond to these situations. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to gain deeper insights into the intricate dynamics of real-life morality.

Taking into account psychological theories, the study uncovers compelling evidence of biases in social morality, wherein blame assignment is influenced by social identities. Moreover, the research examines the commonsense aspects of morality and finds that the moral reasoning used to judge the appropriateness of social behaviors is influenced by social factors of people. Furthermore, the research delves into the most prominent ethical touchpoints within a post that attract attention and generate discussion among commenters. Through an analysis of linguistic patterns, the study reveals that specific portions of ethical points tend to receive more attention. Intriguingly, these portions share common elements across moral situations involving different domains.

Overall, this research offers innovative computational approaches to tackle challenges related to morality. By harnessing the power of NLP techniques, we aim to contribute to theoretical psychological and social computing studies on morality by delving into real-life social situations, providing valuable insights to inform research in this domain.
