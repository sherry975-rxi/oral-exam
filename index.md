### Abstract

Morality presents a complex challenge within society, encompassing a broad spectrum of ethical dilemmas and conflicting perspectives. 
This research focuses on three crucial aspects --blame assignment, moral reasoning, and moral incidents -- to explore real-life morality through insights gained from moral scenarios unfolding within the social media platform r/AmItheAsshole (AITA). 
These scenarios involve interpersonal moral situations shared by authors and judgments provided by other users.

By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, this research integrates linguistic features and psychological theories to investigate the factors contributing to the likelihood of blame assignment. 
The study reveals evidence of biases in social morality, where the allocation of blame is influenced by social identities. 
Moreover, the research examines the commonsense aspects of morality using data from AITA, with a focus on understanding the implicit moral reasoning conveyed in user comments regarding the appropriateness of an author's behavior. 
The results indicate that moral responses are influenced by the social factors of both authors and commenters.

Furthermore, the research delves into the most prominent ethical touchpoints within a post that attract attention and generate discussion among commenters. 
Through an analysis of linguistic patterns, the study reveals that specific portions of ethical points tend to receive more attention. Intriguingly, these portions share common elements across moral situations involving different topics.

Overall, this research offers computational approaches to address challenges related to morality, specifically in the areas of blame assignment, moral reasoning, and moral incidents. By leveraging NLP techniques, the thesis aims to contribute to psychological and social studies on morality by investigating real-life social situations, thereby providing valuable insights to inform laboratory-based research in this domain.
